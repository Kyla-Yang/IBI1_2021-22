Practical 5:
Triangle.py: Pseudocode was missing, and now it is there.
Mystery_code.py: My original answer is wrong. And my new answer is 'output 10 random integers between 1 to 100'.
Practical 6:
The plots were pushed with something wrong and it didn't displayed. The variable for age was absent. And the new version is there.

Improvements:
First, because of the missing of the pseudocode, I paid more attention on writing detailed pseoudocodes in the following weeks (from 7 to 14).
Second, when using matplotlib to draw plots, I examined many times to make sure that all the 'plt.show()' was mentioned and all the plots could be shown.
