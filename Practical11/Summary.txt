Summary:
The score for alignment in human and mouse DLX5 sequence is: 1490
The score for alignment in human DLX5 and random sequence is: -351
The score for alignment in mouse DLX5 and random sequence is: -348
The percentage of identical amino acids for the comparison between human 
and mouse DLX5 sequence is 0.9653979238754326.
The percentage of identical amino acids for the comparison between human 
DLX5 and random sequence is 0.02768166089965398.
The percentage of identical amino acids for the comparison between mouse  
DLX5 and random sequence is 0.031141868512110725.

The code uses BLOSUM_62 to compare and score the similarity of amino acid 
sequences. 
To avoid difficult matrix, it was turned into dataframe by using pandas.
From the obtained results, we can find that DLX5 sequences of human and 
mouse have high similarity, while DLX5 sequences of human and mouse have 
low similarity to random sequences. 
This indicates that amino acid sequence did change to some extent in the 
evolutionary process.
