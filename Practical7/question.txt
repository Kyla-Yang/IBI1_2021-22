Question 1 in the guidance: 
How have new cases and total cases developed over time in Spain?
The line number is from 78 to 102(pseudocode inclusive).

Discussion:
The same method was used in the plot of China's data.
First, pick 'new cases' and 'total cases' out and put them into new 
lists respectively. Second, set the x-axis and y-axis of the dot plot. 
Additionally, use different color to mark different curves.
The plot shows that the number of total cases in Spain increased sharply 
from about March 8th in 2020 and the number of new cases increased from 
2020/03/08 but decreased from about 2020/03/27.
